## React Calculator

This calculator is built using React Hooks and uses the the npm math package to help handle evaluation. It works for basic operations but there are a few issues tracked below and in GitHub that are in progress of being addressed.

### Issues in Progress

-After calculating successfully, if next input is a number, then the previous inputs should be cleared

-If following operations are put in, it should remove final operation

- \*+
- \*/
- //

-A few styling inconsistencies to address

-A couple unneeded boolean props

### Enhancements

-Make it work with keyboard input

-Look into custom hooks
